If you're a newbie interested in Reinforcement Learning (like me) this project may be worth looking at! 
I'd love to answer any questions/discuss the topic: danekbenjamin@gmail.com

Updates to my process of learning reinforcement learning:
The motivation behind undergoing through this rigerous self teaching process is preparing for a project hinged 
on reinforcement learning. This project requires that I know the underlying math (even the gradient-zation parts) like
the back of my hand, and be able to implement it. My math is good, my programming is visible here. 

I'm using all kinds of sources to learn this. 
CS231N Lecture 14 is the foundation, but only covers the theory behind RL

I've found this source to be extremely helpful when it comes to the overview and practical knowledge/heuristics: 
https://simoninithomas.github.io/Deep_reinforcement_learning_Course/

I'll add other sources as I go along.

I can upload my venv at some point as well, but since it's a large file I choose to only do that 
once somebody asks: danekbenjamin@gmail.com

[yes I know its a bit untraditional/unusual]
version name nomenclature:

[flag]xx.y[name-from-gym]; example a00.0CartPole-v0
[flag] - flag (alpha, represents learning and work-in-progress); other flags tbd
 xx - version number
   .y - minor augment to version number
     [name-from-gym] - the name of import/problem from openai gym

TODO
* update keras and tf dependancies
* update full dependancies list
* check for somebody asking about venv
* update any good sources (OneNote?)
